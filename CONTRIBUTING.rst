The PR Process, CircleCI, and Related Gotchas
---------------------------------------------

How to submit a PR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are new to Girder development and you don't have push access to the Girder
repository, here are the steps:

1. `Fork and clone <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ the repository.
2. Create a branch.
3. `Push <https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/>`_ the branch to your GitHub fork.
4. Create a `Pull Request <https://github.com/girder/girder/pulls>`_.

This corresponds to the ``Fork & Pull Model`` mentioned in the
`GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_ guides.

If you have push access to Girder repository, you could simply push your branch
into the main repository and create a `Pull Request <https://github.com/girder/girder/pulls>`_. This
corresponds to the ``Shared Repository Model`` and will facilitate other developers to checkout your
topic without having to `configure a remote <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/>`_.
It will also simplify the workflow when you are *co-developing* a branch.

When submitting a PR, make sure to add a ``Cc: @girder/developers`` comment to notify Girder
developers of your awesome contributions. Based on the
comments posted by the reviewers, you may have to revisit your patches.

Automatic testing of pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you submit a PR to the Girder repo, CircleCI will run the build and test suite on the
head of the branch. If you add new commits onto the branch, those will also automatically
be run through the CI process. The status of the CI process (passing, failing, or in progress) will
be displayed directly in the PR page in GitHub.

The CircleCI build will run according to the `circle.yml file <https://github.com/girder/girder/blob/master/circle.yml>`_,
which is useful as an example for how to set up your own environment for testing.

Your test results will be posted on `Girder's CircleCI dashboard <https://circleci.com/gh/girder>`_.
These results will list any failed tests. Coverage reports and any screenshots
from failed web client tests will be attached to the build as artifact files. You can reach your
build by clicking the build status link on your GitHub PR.

Tracking Public Symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding new public symbols to Girder's python library should only be done intentionally, as doing so
increases the surface of the API and introduces a maintenance burden. Public symbols are packages,
modules, and symbols within those modules that do not start with an underscore character. To help
with this goal, public symbol addition and removal is tracked automatically as part of our CI
process, with the full list of symbols residing in ``scripts/publicNames.txt``

Any PR that adds new public symbols must regenerate the ``scripts/publicNames.txt`` file. This is
done by running the following script::

    python scripts/publicNames.py > scripts/publicNames.txt

Changes to the file should be committed as a part of the PR or not all CI tests will pass.


How to integrate a PR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Getting your contributions integrated is relatively straightforward, here is the checklist:

- All tests pass
- Public symbols list is updated in ``scripts/publicNames.txt``
- Any significant changes are added to the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` with human-readable and understandable
  text (i.e. not a commit message). Text should be placed in the "Unreleased" section, and grouped
  into the appropriate sub-section of:

  - Bug fixes
  - Security fixes
  - Added features
  - Changes
  - Deprecations
  - Removals

- Consensus is reached. This requires that a reviewer adds an "approved" review via GitHub with no
  changes requested, and a reasonable amount of time passed without anyone objecting.

Next, there are two scenarios:

- You do NOT have push access: A Girder core developer will integrate your PR.
- You have push access: Simply click on the "Merge pull request" button.

Then, click on the "Delete branch" button that appears afterward.
