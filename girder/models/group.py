class Group(AccessControlledModel):
    """
    Groups are simply groups of users. The primary use of grouping users is
    to simplify access control for resources in the system, but they can
    be used for other purposes that require groupings of users as well.

    Group membership is stored in the database on the user document only;
    there is no "users" field in this model. This is to optimize for the most
    common use case for querying membership, which involves checking access
    control policies, which is always done relative to a specific user. The
    task of querying all members within a group is much less common and
    typically only performed on a single group at a time, so doing a find on the
    indexed group list in the user collection is sufficiently fast.

    Users with READ access on the group can see the group and its members.
    Users with WRITE access on the group can add and remove members and
    change the name or description.
    Users with ADMIN access can promote group members to grant them WRITE or
    ADMIN access, and can also delete the entire group.

    This model uses a custom implementation of the access control methods,
    because it uses only a subset of its capabilities and provides a more
    optimized implementation for that subset. Specifically: read access is
    implied by membership in the group or having an invitation to join the
    group, so we don't store read access in the access document as normal.
    Another constraint is that write and admin access on the group can only be
    granted to members of the group. Also, group permissions are not allowed
    on groups for the sake of simplicity.
