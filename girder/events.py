"""
This module contains the Girder events framework. It maintains a global mapping
of events to listeners, and contains utilities for callers to handle or trigger
events identified by a name.

Listeners should bind to events by calling:

    ``girder.events.bind('event.name', 'my.handler', handlerFunction)``

And events should be fired in one of two ways; if the event should be handled
synchronously, fire it with:

    ``girder.events.trigger('event.name', info)``

And if the event should be handled asynchronously, use:

    ``girder.events.daemon.trigger('event.name', info, callback)``

For obvious reasons, the asynchronous method does not return a value to the
caller. Instead, the caller may optionally pass the callback argument as a
function to be called when the task is finished. That callback function will
receive the Event object as its only argument.
