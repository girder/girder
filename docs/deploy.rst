Deployment Guide
================

There are many ways to deploy Girder into production. Here is a set of guides on
how to deploy Girder to several different platforms.

Reverse Proxy
-------------

In many cases, it is useful to route multiple web services from a single
server.  For example, if you have a server accepting requests at
``www.example.com``, you may want to forward requests to
``www.example.com/girder`` to a Girder instance listening on port ``9000``.

Apache
++++++

When using Apache, configure Apache's `mod_proxy
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html>`_ to route traffic to
these services using a reverse proxy.  Add the following section to your Apache
config:

.. code-block:: apacheconf

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ProxyPass /girder http://localhost:9000
        ProxyPassReverse /girder http://localhost:9000
    </VirtualHost>

Nginx
+++++

Nginx can be used by adding a block such as:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location /girder/ {
        proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9000/;
        # Must set the following for SSE notifications to work
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        chunked_transfer_encoding off;
        proxy_read_timeout 600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 600s;
        # proxy_request_buffering option only works on nginx >= 1.7.11
        # but is necessary to support streaming requests
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }

And under the containing ``server`` block, make sure to add the following rule:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        client_max_body_size 500M;
        # ... elided configuration
    }

WSGI
----

Girder also comes with a callable WSGI application that can be run with WSGI servers
like `uWSGI`.

A simple example of running Girder with ``uwsgi`` instead of CherryPy's built in HTTP server
would be::

  uwsgi --lazy --http :8080 --module girder.wsgi --check-static clients/web

.. seealso::

   `CherryPy documentation describing how to deploy under WSGI <http://docs.cherrypy.org/en/latest/deploy.html#wsgi-servers>`_


Girder Settings
+++++++++++++++

In such a scenario, Girder must be configured properly in order to serve
content correctly.  This can be accomplished by setting a few parameters in
your local configuration file at ``girder/conf/girder.local.cfg``.  In this
example, we have the following:

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    server.socket_host = "0.0.0.0"
    server.socket_port = 9000
    tools.proxy.on = True

    [server]
    api_root = "/girder/api/v1"
    static_root = "/girder/static"

.. note:: If your chosen proxy server does not add the appropriate
   ``X-Forwarded-Host`` header (containing the host used in http requests,
   including any non-default port to proxied requests), the ``tools.proxy.base``
   and ``tools.proxy.local`` configuration options must also be set in the
   ``[global]`` section as:

   .. code-block:: ini

       tools.proxy.base = "http://www.example.com/girder"
       tools.proxy.local = ""

Docker Container
----------------

Every time a new commit is pushed to master, Docker Hub is updated with a new
image of a docker container running Girder. This container exposes Girder at
port 8080 and requires the database URL to be passed in as an option. For more
information, see the
`Docker Hub Page <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/girder/girder/>`_. Since the
container does not run a database, you'll need to run a command in the form: ::

   $ docker run -p 8080:8080 girder/girder -d mongodb://db-server-external-ip:27017/girder

Google Container Engine
-----------------------

Google Container Engine lets you host and manage Docker containers on Google
Compute Engine instances. Before following the instructions here, follow
Google's tutorial for setting up
`Wordpress <https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/hello-wordpress>`_,
which will make the following steps more clear.

We will assume you have performed ``gcloud auth login`` and
the following environment variables set: ::

    $ export ZONE=us-central1-a
    $ export CLUSTER_NAME=hello-girder

Start a new project in Google Developers Console
(here we assume its identifier is ``my-girder``).
Set this as your active project with ::

    $ gcloud config set project my-girder

Now click the Container Engine menu item on the left of the console
to initialize the container service, then create a new cluster with: ::

    $ gcloud preview container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes 1 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

This will create two instances, a master and a worker: ::

    $ gcloud compute instances list --zone $ZONE
    NAME                    ZONE          MACHINE_TYPE  INTERNAL_IP   EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
    k8s-hello-girder-master us-central1-a n1-standard-2 X.X.X.X       X.X.X.X        RUNNING
    k8s-hello-girder-node-1 us-central1-a n1-standard-2 X.X.X.X       X.X.X.X        RUNNING

The worker will hold
our Docker containers, MongoDB and Girder. The worker needs some extra storage
than the standard 10GB, so let's make a new 100GB storage drive and attach it
to our worker: ::

    $ gcloud compute disks create mongodb --size 100GB --zone $ZONE
    $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk k8s-hello-girder-node-1 --disk mongodb --zone $ZONE

Now we need to ssh into our worker node, which you can do from the Developers Console,
and mount the disk to ``/data``. First we find the name of the device, here ``sdb``. ::

    user_name@k8s-hello-girder-node-1:~$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/google-*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Nov 22 20:31 /dev/disk/by-id/google-mongodb -> ../../sdb
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Nov 22 19:32 /dev/disk/by-id/google-persistent-disk-0 -> ../../sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 22 19:32 /dev/disk/by-id/google-persistent-disk-0-part1 -> ../../sda1

Then we create the directory and mount the drive: ::

    user_name@k8s-hello-girder-node-1:~$ sudo mkdir /data
    user_name@k8s-hello-girder-node-1:~$ sudo /usr/share/google/safe_format_and_mount -m "mkfs.ext4 -F" /dev/sdb /data

Now we are ready to install our pod, which is a collection of containers that
work together. Save the following yaml specification for our MongoDB/Girder pod
to ``pod.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
        version: v1beta1
        id: girder
        kind: Pod
        desiredState:
            manifest:
                version: v1beta2
                containers:
                  -
                    name: mongodb
                    image: dockerfile/mongodb
                    ports:
                      -
                        name: db
                        containerPort: 27017
                    volumeMounts:
                      -
                        name: data
                        mountPath: /data/db
                  -
                    name: application
                    image: girder/girder
                    ports:
                      -
                        name: app
                        containerPort: 8080
                        hostPort: 80
                volumes:
                  -
                    name: data
                    source:
                        hostDir:
                            path: /data/db

Note that we are letting MongoDB use the host's ``/data`` directory,
which will have more space and will persist even if our containers
are shut down and restarted. Start the pod back at your local
command line with: ::

    $ gcloud preview container pods --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME create girder --zone $ZONE --config-file pod.yaml

You can check the status of your pod with: ::

    $ gcloud preview container pods --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME describe girder --zone $ZONE
    ID          Image(s)                          Host                                                     Labels      Status
    ----------  ----------                        ----------                                               ----------  ----------
    girder      dockerfile/mongodb,girder/girder  k8s-hello-girder-node-1.c.hello-girder.internal/X.X.X.X              Running

Add a firewall rule to expose port 80 on your worker: ::

    $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create hello-girder-node-80 --allow tcp:80 --target-tags k8s-hello-girder-node

After everything starts, which may take a few minutes, you should be able
to visit your Girder instance at ``http://X.X.X.X`` where ``X.X.X.X`` is the
IP address in the container description above. Congratulations, you
have a full Girder instance available on Google Container Engine!

Elastic Beanstalk
-----------------

Girder comes with pre-packaged configurations for deploying onto Elastic Beanstalk's
`Python platform <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html#concepts.platforms.python>`_
(both 2.7 and 3.4).

The configurations live within ``devops/beanstalk`` and are designed to be copied into your working Girder directory
at deploy time.

The following assumes you have a checked out copy of Girder (using git) and an existing MongoDB instance which
can be accessed by your Beanstalk application.

.. note:: It is **highly** recommended to perform the following steps in an isolated virtual
	  environment using pip. For more see the documentation for `Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.

From within the checked out copy of Girder, install and configure the CLI tools: ::

  $ pip install awscli awsebcli
  $ aws configure

Initialize the Beanstalk application with a custom name. This is an interactive process
that will ask various questions about your setup (see above for supported platforms): ::

  $ eb init my-beanstalk-app

Build Girder and its client-side assets locally: ::

  $ pip install -e .[plugins]  # optionally build specific plugins
  $ girder-install web --all-plugins  # optionally build specific plugins with --plugins

.. seealso::

   `Building specific plugins with pip <http://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-extra-dependencies-with-pip>`_.

.. note:: Since Girder is unable to restart and load plugins in the Beanstalk environment,
	  plugins may be enabled/disabled but will require a restart of Beanstalk application
	  servers to take effect. Restarting application servers can be performed from the
	  `Environment Management Console <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environments-console.html>`_.

Create a requirements.txt for the Beanstalk application, overwriting the default Girder requirements.txt: ::

  $ pip freeze | grep -v 'girder\|^awscli\|^awsebcli' > requirements.txt

Copy the pre-packaged configurations for Beanstalk into the current directory: ::

  $ cp -r devops/beanstalk/. .

.. note:: These are just the default tested Beanstalk configurations. It's likely that these will have to
	  be modified to suit individual deployments.

Beanstalk deploys code based on commits, so create a git commit with the newly added configurations: ::

  $ git add . && git commit -m "Add Beanstalk configurations"

Create an environment to deploy code to: ::

  $ eb create my-env-name --envvars \
    GIRDER_CONFIG=/opt/python/current/app/girder.cfg,GIRDER_MONGO_URI=mongodb://my-mongo-uri:27017/girder

At this point running ``eb open my-env-name`` should open a functioning Girder instance
in your browser. Additionally, running ``eb terminate`` will terminate the newly created environment.

.. note:: The pre-packaged configurations work with Amazon CloudWatch for aggregating log streams
	  across many application servers. For this to work, the EC2 instances will need the proper
	  policy attached to write to CloudWatch.

.. seealso::

   It may be useful when deploying to AWS to make use of the built-in Girder support
   for `S3 Assetstores <http://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#assetstores>`_.
