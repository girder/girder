The goal of this Vagrantfile and Ansible setup is to provide a fully
functional single VM with Girder, Girder-Worker, and the item_tasks plugin
so that task developers can focus on their Docker images and not have to
deal with setting up an environment to run their Docker images.  This
should lower the barrier to entry of using the item_tasks system.

# Notes

Use with ansible > v 2.2.0 (tested with v2.2.3).

This will port forward the VM's port 8080 (CherryPy/Girder) to the host 9080.

The Girder admin user is girder/girder.

Logs for Girder go to /var/log/upstart/girder.log.
Logs for girder-worker go to /var/log/upstart/girder_worker.log.

To ingest dockerhub docker images, set the variable `item_tasks_dockerhub_images` with
a list of dockerhub image paths.


# Basic operations

These commands should be run from the same directory as this README file,
where the item_tasks Vagrantfile is located.  If these commands are run
from a different directory, the wrong Vagrantfile may be used.

## Create the box for the first time and provision it

`vagrant up`

## Provision the box (it should be safe to do this repeatedly)

`vagrant provision`

## Bring up the box after the first time

`vagrant up`

## ssh into the box as vagrant/vagrant, with passwordless sudo

`vagrant ssh`

## Halt the box

`vagrant halt`
